## CSS

You shouldn't have to touch anything in here if you are using LESS. If you aren't using a CSS pre-processor, please make sure you remove the less/ and sass/ directories to avoid confusion.

#### less/

One of many CSS pre-processors out there. It's no different to standard CSS, but should you need extra power it gives you added functionality, such as helper mixins and CSS variables. Remove if LESS is not used.

#### less/normalize.less

Has some base styles from the HTML5BP, as well as a clearfix and image-replacement class.
